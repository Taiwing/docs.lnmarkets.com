## How to connect to LN Markets using your Ledger wallet?

First, make sure that you use a web browser on which the WebUSB API is
available. You can go
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USB#browser_compatibility)
to check the list of compatible browsers.

Then simply connect your Ledger wallet to your computer, unlock it and run the
Bitcoin application.

Once it's done you can go to LN Markets' home page and click on the 'Ledger'
button in the register or login menu. LN Markets will then proceed to generate a
one-time challenge that you will have to sign with your wallet.
