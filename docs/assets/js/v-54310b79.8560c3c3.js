A CFD is an Over The Counter (OTC) financial contract, generally between a client and a broker, where the difference in the settlement between the open and closing trade prices are cash-settled. With CFDs, there is no delivery of physical goods or securities.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-side" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-side" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is the side?</h2><p>The side of a position is long for a buy order and short for a sell order.</p><p>On LN Markets, you can find the global side of all open positions in the Risk blotter.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-buy-order" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-buy-order" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is a buy order?</h2><p>A buy order is an order to purchase a specified quantity of a financial product.

For instance, for a long position to be unwind, one needs to sell the contract.</p><p>Price for this sell order is the bid price, then price reference for this position is the bid price. Conversely, for a short position to be unwind, one needs to buy the contract. Price for this buy order is the offer price, then the price reference for this position is the offer price.</p><p>This rule applies to P&amp;L computation, take profit and liquidation orders.</p><p>Long position example: We open a long market order at a Price = 38541.5. A few minutes later, Bid-Offer is: 38427.5 - 38504.5. Since it is a long position, our price reference is: 38427.5. Short position example: We open a short market order at a Price = 38419.0. A few minutes later, Bid-Offer is: 38396.5 - 38473.5. Since it is a short position, our price reference is: 38473.5.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-quantity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-quantity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is the quantity?</h2><p>The quantity is the number of contracts you want to trade.</p><p>On LN Markets, each contract is worth 1 USD, margin and P&amp;L are expressed in sats (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis or sats).</p><h2 id="what-is-the-margin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-margin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is the margin?</h2><p>When buyers and sellers want to enter a Bitcoin derivatives position, to make sure they honor their contractual obligations, exchanges and trading platforms require them to deposit and maintain an account funded with Bitcoin as collateral: this is called the margin.</p><p>On LN Markets, each margin is dedicated to a specific position. Hence, a trader can have different positions with a specific margin policy for each one.</p><p>There are 3 ways to define the Margin:</p><ul><li>Set it directly</li><li>Calculate it using the leverage</li><li>Calculate it using the liquidation price</li></ul><p>Margin is expressed in sats (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis or sats).</p><h2 id="what-is-the-leverage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-leverage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is the leverage?</h2><p>Leverage in trading is an investment strategy that allows to gain exposure to a financial asset with a smaller upfront capital, known as margin.</p><p>Leverage is a double-edged sword. With a leverage of 1, you are exposed to the variations of the underlying asset. With a leverage of 2, for a long position, when the underlying asset increases by 1, your P&amp;L increases by 2. But when the underlying asset decreases by 1, your P&amp;L decreases by 2.
